### Message to the TA
Slack is down so I need a way to communicate with the TA Henry.  The first thing I thought of was to try to contact AskBCS but they use Slack also.  What happens is when I try to log in with the email I used for the class, it says it is sending a code to me by email, but I never receive it.  I have tried multiple times and I checked the Spam folder to see if it was in there. Nope. Nada. 

I thought of this idea to create a .md file in a different repo than my final project, and include a LINK to this message in the text section of the Segment Three deliverable when I submit it.  There are limitations to this idea- the main drawback is it is a ONE WAY communication.  The second issue I can think of is without access to Slack, I can't get FEEDBACK on the deliverables I submittd so far.  Third, and this is speculation on my part - I believe we should probably use the official channels to communicate for this class so any feedback regarding grades is recorded and documented.

My proposal is THIS - until I get my Slack account working - understanding that Henry still has to use the "official" feedback mechanisms to communicate with me- I request that Henry post the feeback to me on Slack but also send me a screen capture of it BY EMAIL.  Is that OKAY? [I was going to include my email but then I figured out how to log in to Slack after all]

I finally cracked the code of how to log back in to Slack

So I guess we no longer have to use this method after all, but I will keep a copy of this message anyway just in case I need it again.

Meanwhile here is a test link to the draft slides as a test of whether the SHARE button in Google Slides actually works.
