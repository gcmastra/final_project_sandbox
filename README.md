## Part 2 - Team Assessment

Due to some health issues that happened to coincide with the first week of the project, I decided in conjunction with the instructor and Student Success Manager, to work individually on the project.  This meant having two topic changes before finally deciding on a project of my own, and less time to complete all the segments. EVen though I was unable to complete some parts of the project, I still learned a lot, and I may continue to work on this subject as a hobby even after the class ends. I still have a goal of training a neural network with a coda nased on my own writings, and find out what insights can be derived. 

## Part 3 - Summary of project (which can be used as a "blurb" on LinkedIn or on resume"

Natural Language Processing (NLP) Word Embedding Model using  a Deep Learning Neural Network to train a large word vector file.  Used a Gobal Vector file based on the Wikipedia coda from the punblic domain and trained the model to show semantic relationships and similarities between words.  Proposal for future work - to create my own large vector file based on a coda of my own writing, aka my Personal Blog (https://gcmastra.wordpress.com/)
